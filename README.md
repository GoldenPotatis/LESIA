# LESIA  building load culstering analysis tool

The full name of LESIA project is: **Community-based Local Energy System in Industrial Areas in Sweden**.  
Introduction of LESIA project can be found at RISE website [LESIA](https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/projects/community-based-local-energy-system-in-industrial-areas-in-sweden).

The Working Package 3 (WP3) of LESIA project aims at the investigation, evaluation, and analysis of current energy systems of industrial areas in Sweden in general and one specific case study (Viared industrial area in Bor√•s). Two tasks in WP3 are to gather energy data from stakeholders and map the current energy systems in Viared. After collecting the electricity consumption data, there is a need to analyse the energy data for mapping the system. Therefore, this repository is intended to fill this gap.  

This repository contains a tool that can automatically take in a building's electricity consumption data and perform electricity load profile clustering analysis.
The building's electricity consumption data should be a time series data that contains 8760 hours recordings.
The tool can take in the data and perform the following tasks:
### 1. Data cleaning and preperation
* **Check missing values**  
  Detect and remove missing values and set to 0
* **Check outliers**  
  Using IOR method to detect outliers and set to 0
* **Fill missing values and outliers**  
  Using simple moving average method to fill the detected missing values and outliers with a window size 3
* **Data segmentation**  
  Segment the 8760 hours time series data into daily form of 365 days $\times$ 24 hours
* **Data normalisation**  
  Using annual electricity consumption max to normalise the raw data  
  $x_{normalised} = \Large\frac{x_{raw}}{x_{annual max}}$

### 2. Clustering analysis and visualisation
